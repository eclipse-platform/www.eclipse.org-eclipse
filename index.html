		<h2>About the Eclipse Project</h2>
		<p>
			The Eclipse project is an Eclipse Foundation project,
			overseen by a
			<a href="https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/eclipse/who#project-role-PL">Project Management Committee</a>
			(PMC)
			and project leads.
			Development takes place in subprojects working on various GitHub repositories.
			The <a href="eclipse-charter.html">Eclipse Project Charter</a>
			describes the organization of the project,
			roles and responsibilities of the participants,
			and the top-level development process for the project.
		</p>
		<h3>
			Equinox
		</h3>
		<p>
			The Equinox project provides an implementation of the
			<a href="https://docs.osgi.org/specification/">OSGi core framework specification</a>,
			a set of bundles that implement various optional OSGi services,
			and other infrastructure for running OSGi-based systems.
			It is the runtime basis for the Platform's plug-in runtime.
		</p>
		<h3>
			Platform
		</h3>
		<p>
			The Platform project defines the set of frameworks and common services that collectively
			make up &quot;integration-ware&quot; required to support the use of Eclipse as a component model,
			as a rich client platform (<a
				href="https://github.com/eclipse-platform/eclipse.platform.ui/blob/master/docs/Rich_Client_Platform.md">RCP</a>),
			and as a comprehensive tool integration platform.
			These services and frameworks include a standard workbench user interface model
			and a portable native widget toolkit,
			a project model for managing resources,
			automatic resource delta management for incremental compilers and builders,
			language-independent debug infrastructure,
			and infrastructure for distributed multi-user versioned resource management.
		</p>
		<h3>
			Java Development Tools
		</h3>
		<p>
			The JDT project provides plug-ins that implement a Java IDE for power-users,
			that supports the development of any Java application,
			including Eclipse plug-ins.
			JDT adds the concept of Java projects and a Java perspective to the Eclipse platform,
			as well as a number of views, editors, wizards, builders, and code merging and refactoring tools.
			JDT allows Eclipse to be a development environment for itself.
			JDT's plug-ins themselves can also be further extended by other tool builders.
		</p>
		<h3>
			Plug-in Development Environment
		</h3>
		<p>
			The PDE project provides a number of views and editors that make is easier to build plug-ins for Eclipse.
			Using the PDE, you can create your plug-in manifest file (plugin.xml),
			specify your plug-in runtime and other required plug-ins,
			define extension points, including their specific markup,
			associate XML Schema files with the extension point markup so extensions can be validated,
			create extensions of other plug-in extension points, and so on.
			PDE makes integrating plug-ins easy.
		</p>
		<h3>
			Eclipse SDK
		</h3>
		<p>
			These four project comprise the <a href="http://download.eclipse.org/eclipse">Eclipse SDK</a>
			a complete development environment for Eclipse-based tools,
			and for developing Eclipse itself.

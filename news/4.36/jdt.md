### Custom Folding Regions

It is now possible to create custom folding regions by specifying a comment at the start and end of the region.
You can enable and configure this feature under `Window > Preferences > Java > Editor > Folding > Custom folding regions`.

![Preference page for custom folding regions](images/custom_folding_regions_preferences.png)

on that preference page, you can specify the text that should be used to start and end a custom folding region.
When this is enabled,
writing a comment starting with the specified region start followed by another comment starting with the specified region end creates a folding region.

Custom folding regions can be collapsed like any other folding regions.

### Project Properties Page for Folding
				
Preferences for folding can now be configured on a per-project basis in addition to configuring folding for the workspace.
This page is available under `Project > Properties > Java Editor > Folding`.

### New folding mechanism as Default

In the previous release, a preference to enable different kinds of folding was introduced,
see the news for [4.35](../4.35/jdt.html#new-folding).
The feature has been further improved since then and is now **enabled by default**.

This feature enhances the code folding mechanism in Eclipse JDT by enabling folding for control statements 
such as **if**, **while**, **switch**, and **for**.
It improves code readability and navigation by allowing developers to collapse and expand structured blocks.

The feature can be disabled in the settings under `Java > Editor > Folding`.

### Collapsing Stack Frames

Navigating in deep stack frames can be challenging during debuging, due to the high number of stack frames that are not relevant most of the time,
for example because they are provided by either the JDK, by a testing framework, or by a library.
This feature tries to help focus on the stack frames that are coming from the user-created projects,
drastically reducing the unnecessary noise in the Debug View.

![Original](images/not-collapsed.png)

The feature can be enabled from the Debug toolbar in `Debug > Java > Collapse Stack Frames`.

After enabling it, the view becomes much simpler and less intimidating:

### Navigate to Variable Declaration

Users can now navigate to a variableâ€™s declaration directly from the Variables view during a debug session,
making it easier to locate a variable, especially in methods with numerous local variables.

Choose `Navigate to Declaration` from context menu of a variable.

The editor will jump and highlight its declaration.

### Auto-Resuming Trigger Points

Trigger points can now be configured to automatically resume execution when hit,
allowing breakpoints after the trigger point to be activated while skipping those before it,
thereby enabling a more focused and efficient debugging workflow.

Upon enabling a trigger point, a new option will be shown to `Continue execution on hit` or not.

![Triggerpoint Enabled](images/TriggerEnabled.png)

Once `Continue execution on hit` is toggled, the breakpoint label will update to `[Resume on hit]` meaning it won't suspend on hit.

![Triggerpoint Continue](images/TriggerContinue.png)

Resume trigger also supports conditions, meaning if condition is true it will resume the execution otherwise it will suspend.

![Resume-Triggerpoint with conditions](images/ResumeWithCondition.png)

Now when you run in debug mode, the trigger point won't hit, allowing you to skip previous breakpoints, and stop on the actual breakpoint on which you need to focus.

For example, here `Resume trigger` was set on line number 7 and during debugging it hit on line number 8 by skipping all the previous breakpoints.

### Improved Disabled Icons Generation <!-- https://github.com/eclipse-platform/eclipse.platform.swt/pull/1936 -->
Up to now, disabled versions of icons usually were and had to be provided as explicit, separate image files.
In case no such icon was provided, an algorithm in SWT was used to generate a disabled icon. However, that
algorithm was very limited and produced hardly usable results.

The algorithm in SWT was now improved such that results are by default equal to the disabled version of the
icons that have explicitly been provided for the Eclipse Platform bundles. The pre-generated disabled icons
have been replaced with the usage of on-the-fly generated disabled versions of the icons via the SWT algorithm.
This particularly includes the removal of `disabledIcon` in `plugin.xml` files and programmatically setting the
`disabledImageDescriptor` for `Actions`.

In addition, the algorithm for the calculation of disabled versions of icons became exchangeable. The
algorithm can be changed via the system property `org.eclipse.swt.image.disablement` with the
following options:
- `grayed` (default): produces a gray-scaled version of the icon, which is aligned with the
  existing, pre-generated disabled versions of icons for Eclipse bundles
- `desaturated` (preview): produces a desaturated version of the icon, comparable to the
  `grayed` version but still keeping some color in it; the configuration of this option may be
  subject to change in future releases of Eclipse
- `gtk`: produces an icon version that conforms with the default disablement algorithm of GTK

The following screenshots demonstrate the different options.

| Option | Example |
| --- | --- |
| `grayed` | ![Disablement option 'grayed'](images/disabled_icons_grayed.png) |
| `desaturated` | ![Disablement option 'desaturated'](images/disabled_icons_desaturated.png) |
| `gtk` | ![Disablement option 'gtk'](images/disabled_icons_gtk.png) |

## Debug

### Custom Labels for Breakpoints <!-- https://github.com/eclipse-platform/eclipse.platform/pull/1803 -->
Managing breakpoints in large codebases just got easier. You can now assign `custom labels` to breakpoints in the `Breakpoints view`.
When debugging complex applications, it's common to set numerous breakpoints. Identifying the important ones quickly can be 
time-consuming and error-prone. 

This new feature allows you to add meaningful labels to breakpoints so that you can locate, categorize, and prioritize them more effectively.

To label a breakpoint, simply right-click on a breakpoint in the `Breakpoints view` and choose `Label`.

Now provide appropriate label of your choice or leave blank to show default label

Once a label is assigned, the labeled breakpoint is visually highlighted for easier identification

This improves clarity when navigating through breakpoints during complex debugging sessions, and enhances overall productivityâ€”especially
in projects with dozens of breakpoints.

## General Updates

### Monitor-Specific UI Scaling as Default (Windows only)

In the previous releases, a preference to enable an improved, monitor- and resolution-specific UI scaling on Windows was introduced,
see the news for [4.34](../4.34/platform.html#rescale-on-runtime-preference)
and [4.35](../4.35/platform.html#rescaleOnRuntimePreference) for details.
The feature has been further improved since then and is now **enabled by default**.

The feature makes each window adapt its scaling to the monitor it is currently placed on in a sharp, resolution-specific way
and without requiring the application to restart.
When using multiple windows, each of them will adapt its scaling to the monitor it is placed on.
When enabled, this new feature replaces the current, limited scaling support for high-resolution monitors,
which initializes the application's window according to the scaling of the primary monitor at application startup
and produces blurry scaling when moving the window to another monitor unless the application is restarted.

To disable this feature, uncheck the _Monitor-specific UI scaling_ box on the **Appearance** preference page
(`Window > Preferences > General > Appearance`),
as shown in the image below.
The feature is still under further development. We encourage users to **share their feedback** to help us improve the functionality.

The images below demonstrate the scaling behavior in an extract of an Eclipse application when moving the window
from a primary monitor with 100% scaling to another monitor with 200% scaling, first having the feature disabled
and second having it enabled.

On a 200% monitor with the feature being **disabled**:

### Support for SVG Images <!-- https://github.com/eclipse-platform/eclipse.platform.swt/pull/1638 -->

Until now, Eclipse only supported loading of raster graphics. This limited the ability to scale icons without
quality loss and required manual rasterization of SVG files outside to generate icons in different sizes that can
be embedded in Eclipse products, leading to additional effort and many separate icon files.

Support for vector graphics (SVG) has now been added. Instead of providing multiple rasterized images for different
sizes, a single SVG file can be referenced. The SVG is rasterized on-the-fly at the required size
when the image is retrieved at runtime. This ensures optimal image quality for arbitrary scaling factors
without manual preprocessing. Support for loading raster graphics remains available.
Together with the [on-the-fly generation of disabled versions of icons](#improved-disabled-icons-generation-),
only one source file per icon needs to be managed for all required zoom levels as well as their visualization in
enabled and disabled state.

As part of this change, most icons across all Eclipse SDK bundles have been added as SVGs, and the corresponding paths
(e.g., in `plugin.xml` files) have been updated accordingly. 

For icons that were not available as SVGs, new SVGs were either created manually or generated automatically. The automatic approach was used in particular for all wizard icons, as these contain many intricate details that make manual redesign challenging. In these cases, the rasterized images were converted to SVGs using the Trace Bitmap feature in Inkscape (accessible via Path -> Trace Bitmap -> Pixel Art). Depending on the complexity of the original image, this process may result in SVG files containing many paths and therefore having a large file size. However, performance tests showed that rasterizing such large SVGs does not noticeably increase the rendering time. This makes the method a practical solution for converting complex raster graphics into SVG format without requiring manual effort.

This improvement is especially beneficial for High-DPI displays, where crisp, scalable icons enhance the
visual appearance and usability of the user interface. It also ensures better adaptation to different display
settings and dynamic scaling scenarios.

**DEPRECATION NOTE:** The obsolete PNG files are now considered deprecated. They may be *removed with Eclipse 2027-06*.

The following screenshots compare the use of raster graphics and vector graphics when loading icons with 125% monitor scaling.

### Support Launching with a Terminal Console

<details>

When launching a process in Eclipse you can currently choose to allocate a console for input/output.
Via such a console, the relatively-recent support for ANSI color encoding enables integration of console applications that produce colorized output.

In terms of input though,
and for more advanced features such as text-based user interaction,
this still does not work well 
because advanced applications require a so-called [pseudo terminal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudoterminal)
together with a [terminal emulator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_emulator)
to behave as if it were executed via a native command prompt.

While the [VT100 terminal emulator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VT100) was already added  in the previous release,
there remained the need to start the application in a proper terminal session.
That support is now provided by the new `Terminal Console`.

This is currently preliminary support and we would appreciate to get feedback.
Please don't hesitate to open an [issue](https://github.com/eclipse-platform/eclipse.platform/issues)
if something is missing or not working as expected.

The terminal support can be installed as follows:

- Download the latest integration build SDK [here](https://download.eclipse.org/eclipse/downloads/).
- Go to `Help > Install New Software` and add the site https://download.eclipse.org/eclipse/updates/4.37-I-builds/ then select
  `Terminal Feature` and `Terminal Session Support`.
- Now in the toolbar choose the `Open a Terminal` icon ensure the `Terminal` view works for your platform.

Now that the terminal console support is installed, you can use it.
You can install m2e PDE support from https://download.eclipse.org/technology/m2e/releases/latest/
and then use this [example project](examples/terminal-example.zip):

- Open the `console.target` and set it as active target platform.
- Open the `console.product` and start it; you will see a warning and some garbled characters.
- Go to the launch configuration and then open the tab `Common` and choose `Allocate Terminal`.
- Run it again and you will get colorized content and auto-completion using `<tab>`.

We added rudimentary searching capabilities to `Browser` widgets based on WebKit and GTK+.
The search is enabled by setting the `SWT.SEARCH` style flag of the `Browser` widget.
The hotkey to open the search dialog is `Ctrl+F`,
the dialog opens at the bottom left of the client area of the Browser widget. See screenshots below.

The search dialog is closed with `Esc`.
Its also closed when resizing or moving the `Browser` widget or its parent `Shell`.
The dialog can be dragged and will remember its position until such a resize or move.

The search can be disabled globally with the following VM property, e.g. in case of WebKit crashes:

```
-Dorg.eclipse.swt.internal.webkitgtk.disableBrowserSearch=true
```

Searching in the `Help Contents` dialog:

The [OSGi Testing Support](https://github.com/eclipse-osgi-technology/osgi-test#osgi-testing-support) is a great library for testing OSGi applications,
and PDE now add first-class support as it does for OSGi Annotations already.

To enable this do the following:

1. Make sure your target platform contains the necessary OSGi test dependencies, to make this more easy PDE provides a feature named `org.eclipse.pde.osgitest.dependencies.feature`.
2. Go to the [Build Path Settings](https://help.eclipse.org/latest/topic/org.eclipse.jdt.doc.user/reference/ref-properties-build-path.htm) and add the JUNIT Library under the [Libraries Tab](https://help.eclipse.org/latest/topic/org.eclipse.jdt.doc.user/reference/ref-properties-build-path.htm#libraries) but do not add any JUnit or OSGi Testing imports/requirements to your manifest!
3. Place your Tests into a source folder marked as test source

PDE will then automatically add required dependencies for OSGi Testing Support and you can use all the standard annotations right now.

After that just run your tests as the usual plugin test, you can find an example [here](examples/osgitest-example.zip), if you find any issues or has suggestions don't hesitate to let us know and open an issue [here](https://github.com/eclipse-pde/eclipse.pde/issues).

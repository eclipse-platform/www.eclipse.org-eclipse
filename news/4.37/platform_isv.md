## Platform Changes
-->
# Terminal View and Connectors are now available from Platform

The previously provided Terminal View and the Local, SHH and Telnet Connectors from the CDT Project are now migrated to the Eclipse Platform to make it generally available.
It has been part of the Eclipse EPPs for along time already and proven an useful extension to Eclipse IDE!

To use it in your own product, or install it in a custom Eclipse IDE setup you can from now on use the feature `org.eclipse.terminal.feature`.

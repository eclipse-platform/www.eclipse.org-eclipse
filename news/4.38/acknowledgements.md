## Eclipse 2025-12 Acknowledgements

We would also like to thank the users and adopters who support our efforts through a range of activities, including early testing, being a Friend of Eclipse, contracting special work, or outright employment.

A special thanks goes to [Holger Voormann](https://github.com/howlger) for his Eclipse IDE promotion videos.

Another special thanks to other Eclipse projects we build upon: EMF and ECF, who also provide timely updates so we can release on time.
We also thank the other Eclipse projects that make up part of the infrastructure we depend on: Tycho, Orbit, EGit, EMF, and ECF for providing fixes and steady improvements.

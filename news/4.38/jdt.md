The Variables view now provides an option to compare a selected variableâ€™s `toString()` value directly with the current clipboard content. 
The values open in a comparison viewer where differences are clearly highlighted, making it easier to verify actual values against expected results quickly and accurately.


To use this, select a variable from `Variables View` and choose `Compare With Clipboard` from its content menu

For `objects`, the clipboard content is compared to their `toString()` value.

Comparison also works with `Arrays` and `Primitives` too.

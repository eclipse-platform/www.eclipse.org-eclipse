		<h1>Eclipse Project Charter</h1>
		<h2>Overview</h2>
		The Eclipse Top Level Project (the &quot;Eclipse Project&quot;) is an open source
		software development project dedicated to providing a robust, full-featured, commercial-quality,
		and freely available industry platform for the development of highly
		integrated tools. This document describes the mission, scope, and
		organization of this Top Level Project and its constituent Projects, and
		roles and responsibilities of the participants.
		</p>
		<h2>Mission</h2>
		<p>
			The Eclipse Project provides a kind of universal tool platform - an open extensible IDE for
			anything and yet nothing in particular. The real value comes from tool
			plug-ins that &quot;teach&quot; the platform how to work with things - java files,
			web content, graphics, video - almost anything one can imagine. Eclipse
			allows tool builders to independently develop tools that integrate with other
			people's tools so seamlessly you can't tell where one tool ends and another
			starts.</p>
		<p>The success of the platform depends on how well it enables a wide range of tool
			builders to build best of breed integrated tools. But the real vision of
			an industry platform is only realized if these tools from
			different tool builders can be combined together by users to suit their unique
			requirements, in ways that the tool builders never even imagined. </p>
		<p>The mission of the Eclipse Project is to adapt and evolve the Eclipse
			technology to meet the needs of the Eclipse tool building community and its
			users, so that the vision of an industry tooling platform is realized.</p>
		<h2>Scope</h2>
		The Eclipse Project encompasses two principle areas of work:
		<ol>
			<li><b>Tool integration platforms.</b> Developing the core frameworks
				and technologies upon which others can build software development tools of all kinds.</li>
			<li><b>The tools required to build and extend these platforms.</b> Creating
				the tools that the Eclipse project committers need in order to build the tool integration
				platforms, and the tools the community needs to extend and adopt the platforms.</li>
		</ol>
		This secondary tool creation goal has a number of important objectives. First, it provides
		an initial &quot;customer&quot; for the platform, to ensure the requirements of real
		development tools are met by the platform. Second, it encourages community adoption
		of the platform. The easier it is for the community to adopt and extend the platform,
		the more successful the project will be. Finally, it allows the project contributors
		to continuously &quot;self host&quot; on the tool platform as it is being built. This
		creates a tight feedback loop that ensure the platform is robust, and meets the
		needs of real tool users.
		</p>
		<h2>Project Management Committee</h2><a name="PMC"></a>
		The Projects under this Charter are managed by a group known as the Project
		Management Committee (the &quot;PMC&quot;).</p>
		<p>PMCs are expected to ensure that:</p>
		<p>All Projects operate effectively by providing
			leadership to guide the Project's overall direction and by removing
			obstacles, solving problems, and resolving conflicts.</p>
		<p>All Project plans, technical documents and reports are publicly available</p>
		<p>All Projects operate using open source rules of
			engagement: meritocracy, transparency, and open participation.
			These principles work together. Anyone can participate in a
			Project. This open interaction,
			from answering questions to reporting bugs to making code contributions to
			creating designs, enables everyone to recognize and utilize the contributions.</p>
		<p>The PMC has the following responsibilities:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Providing the leadership and vision to guide the Project's overall direction
				and architecture.</li>
			<li>Providing assistance and
				support to the developers and researchers working on the Project by
				removing obstacles, solving problems, and resolving conflicts.</li>
			<li>Ensuring that Project plans
				are produced.</li>
			<li>Working with the Eclipse
				Management Organization (the &quot;EMO&quot;) to establish the development
				processes and infrastructure needed for the development team to be
				effective.</li>
			<li>Recommending new Projects to the EMO.</li>
			<li>Recommending the initial set
				of Project committers for each new Project overseen by the PMC, and
				establishing the procedures consistent with this Charter for voting in
				new committers.</li>
			<li>Helping to ensure that the
				Projects overseen by the PMC have enough contributors, and working to
				fill vacancies in roles.</li>
			<li>Producing &quot;how to get
				involved&quot; guidelines to help new potential contributors get started.</li>
			<li>Coordinating relationships
				with other Eclipse Foundation Projects.</li>
			<li>Facilitating code or other
				donations by individuals or companies.</li>
			<li>Making recommendations to the
				Eclipse Foundation Board regarding contributions proposed under licenses
				other than the EPL.</li>
			<li>Working with the EMO and
				Committers to ensure in-bound contributions are made in accordance with
				the Eclipse Foundation IP Policy.</li>
			<li>Acting as a focal point for
				the community in representing the Projects it oversees.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>The PMC Lead is appointed by the Board. The initial PMC is selected by the
			PMC Lead. Thereafter, to become a member of the PMC, an individual must be
			nominated by another member of the PMC, and unanimously approved by all PMC
			members.</p>
		<p>In the unlikely event that a member of the PMC becomes disruptive to the
			process or ceases to contribute for an extended period, the member may be
			removed by unanimous vote of remaining PMC members.
			PMC members may resign at any time by delivering notice of
			their resignation to the PMC Lead.</p>
		<p>The PMC is responsible for producing and maintaining the Project Charter.
			Development must conform to any rules or processes outlined in the Charter,
			so a change to the development process may necessitate a change to the
			Charter. Changes to the Charter
			are approved by the Board.</p>
		<p>The work of the PMC is shared by the PMC members. All PMC members are
			expected to contribute actively. In particular, PMC members are expected to
			take responsibility for overseeing certain areas of work in the Project, and
			reporting to the PMC on these areas.</p>
		<p>Active participation in the user forums and the appropriate developer
			mailing lists is a responsibility of all PMC members, and is critical to the
			success of the Project. PMC members are required to monitor the main Project
			mailing list, and the developer mailing lists for all Projects and components
			they are overseeing.</p>
		<h2>Roles</h2>
		<p>The Projects under this Charter are operated as meritocracies -- the more you
			contribute, and the higher the quality of your contribution, the more you are
			allowed to do. However with this comes increased responsibility.</p>
		<h2>Users</h2>
		<p>Users are the people who use the products that the Project produces. People
			in this role aren't contributing code, but they are using the products,
			reporting bugs, and making feature requests and suggestions. Users are
			encouraged to participate through the user forum(s), asking questions,
			providing suggestions, and helping other users. Users are also encouraged to
			report problem reports using the bug tracking system. </p>
		<h2>Developers</h2>
		<p>Users who contribute code or documentation become developers. Developers are
			the people who contribute code, fixes, documentation, or other work that goes
			into the product. Developers are also encouraged to participate in the user
			forum(s), and should monitor the developer mailing list associated with
			their area of contribution. When appropriate, developers may also contribute
			to development design discussions related to their area of contribution.
			Developers are expected to be proactive in reporting problems in the bug tracking
			system.</p>
		<h2>Committers</h2>
		<p>Developers who give frequent and valuable contributions to a Project, or
			component of a Project (in the case of large Projects), can have their status
			promoted to that of a &quot;Committer&quot; for that Project or component
			respectively. A Committer has write access to the source code repository for
			the associated Project (or component), and gains voting rights allowing them
			to affect the future of the Project (or component).</p>
		<p>In order for a Developer to become a Committer on a particular Project
			overseen by the PMC, another Committer for the same Project (or component as
			appropriate) can nominate that Developer or the Developer can ask to be
			nominated. Once a Developer is nominated, the Committers for the Project (or
			component) will vote. If there are at least 3 positive votes and no negative
			votes, the Developer is recommended to the PMC for commit privileges. If the
			PMC also approves, the Developer is converted into a Committer and given
			write access to the source code repository for that Project (or component).
			Becoming a Committer is a privilege that is earned by contributing and
			showing discipline and good judgement. It is a responsibility that should be
			neither given nor taken lightly.</p>
		<p>At times, Committers may go inactive for a variety of reasons. The
			decision making process of the Project relies on active committers who
			respond to discussions and votes in a constructive and timely manner. The PMC
			is responsible for ensuring the smooth operation of the Project. A Committer
			that is disruptive, does not participate actively, or has been inactive for
			an extended period may have his or her commit status removed by the PMC.</p>
		<p>Active participation in the user forums and the appropriate developer
			mailing lists is a responsibility of all Committers, and is critical to the
			success of the Project. Committers are required to monitor and contribute to
			the user forums.</p>
		<p>Committers are required to monitor the developer mailing list associated
			with all Projects and components for which they have commit privileges. This
			is a condition of being granted commit rights to the Project or component. It
			is mandatory because committers must participate in votes (which in some
			cases require a certain minimum number of votes) and must respond to the
			mailing list in a timely fashion in order to facilitate the smooth operation
			of the Project. When a Committer is granted commit rights they will be added
			to the appropriate mailing lists. A Committer must not be unsubscribed from a
			developer mailing list unless their associated commit privileges are also
			removed.</p>
		<p>Committers are required to track, participate in, and vote on, relevant
			discussions in their associated Projects and components. There are three
			voting responses: +1 (yes), -1 (no, or veto), and 0 (abstain).</p>
		<p>Committers are responsible for proactively reporting problems in the bug
			tracking system, and annotating problem reports with status information,
			explanations, clarifications, or requests for more information from the
			submitter. Committers are responsible for updating problem reports when they
			have done work related to the problem.</p>
		<h2>Projects</h2>
		<p>The work under this Top Level Project is further organized into Projects. New
			Projects must be significant works consistent with the mission of the Top
			Level Project, be recommended by the PMC, and confirmed by the EMO. Projects
			can be discontinued by decision of the Board.</p>
		<p>When a new Project is created, the PMC nominates a Project lead to act as
			the technical leader and nominates the initial set of Committers for the
			Project, and these nominations are approved by the EMO. Project leads are accountable to the
			PMC for the success of their Project.</p>
		<h2>Project Components</h2>
		<p>The PMC may decide to divide a Project further into components. If a Project
			is divided into components, commit privileges are normally granted at the
			component level, and the committers for a given component vote on issues
			specific to that component. Components are established and discontinued by
			the PMC. When the PMC creates a component it appoints a component lead to act
			as the technical leader and names the initial set of Committers for the
			component. The component lead is designated as a committer for the Project
			and represents the component in discussions and votes pertaining to the
			Project as a whole. Component Committers do not participate in votes at the
			level of the Project as a whole, unless they are also the component lead.</p>
		<h2>Infrastructure</h2>
		<p>The PMC works with the EMO to ensure the required infrastructure for the
			Project. The Project
			infrastructure will include, at minimum:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Bug Database - Bugzilla
				database for tracking bugs and feature requests.</li>
			<li>Source Repository -- One or
				more source code repositories containing both the master source code and
				documentation for the Projects.</li>
			<li>Website - A website will
				contain information about the Project, including documentation,
				downloads of releases, and this Charter.</li>
			<li>General Mailing List -
				Mailing list for development discussions pertaining to the Project as a
				whole or that cross Projects. This mailing list is open to the public.</li>
			<li>Project Mailing Lists -
				Development mailing list for technical discussions related to the
				Project. This mailing list is open to the public.</li>
			<li>Component Mailing Lists --
				Development mailing list for technical discussions related to the
				component. This mailing list is open to the public.</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>The Development Process</h2>
		<p>Each Project lead must produce a development plan for the release cycle, and
			the development plan must be approved by the PMC and by a majority of
			Committers of the Project.</p>
		<p>Each Project must identify, and make available on its web site, the
			requirements and prioritizations it is working against in the current release
			cycle. In addition, each Project must post a release plan showing the date
			and content of the next major release, including any major milestones, and
			must keep this plan up to date.</p>
		<p>The Committers of a Project or component decide which changes may be
			committed to the master code base of a Project or component respectively.
			Three +1 ('yes' votes) with no -1 ('no' votes or vetoes) are needed to
			approve a code change. Vetoes must be followed by an explanation for the veto
			within 24 hours or the veto becomes invalid. All votes are conducted via the
			developer mailing list associated with the Project or component.</p>
		<p>Special rules may be established by the PMC for Projects or components
			with fewer than three Committers. For efficiency, some code changes from some
			contributors (e.g. feature additions, bug fixes) may be approved in advance,
			or approved in principle based on an outline of the work, in which case they
			may be committed first and changed as needed, with conflicts resolved by
			majority vote of the Committers of the Project or component, as applicable.
			More restrictive rules for releasing changes may be established by the PMC
			near the end of release cycles or for maintenance streams.</p>
		<p>The master copy of the code base must reside on the Project web site where
			it is accessible to all users, developers and committers. Committers must
			check their changes and new work into the master code base as promptly as
			possible (subject to any check-in voting rules that may be in effect) in
			order to foster collaboration among widely distributed groups and so that the
			latest work is always available to everyone. The PMC is responsible for
			working with the Eclipse Foundation to establish a release engineering and
			build process to ensure that builds can be reliably produced on a regular and
			frequent basis from the master code base and made available for download from
			the Project web site.</p>
		<p>The PMC is responsible for establishing the level of testing appropriate
			for each Project, and approving the test plans.</p>
		<p>All development technical discussions are conducted using the development
			mailing lists. If discussions are held offline, then a summary must be posted
			to the mailing list to keep the other committers informed.</p>
		<h2>Licensing</h2>
		<p>All contributions to Projects under this Charter must adhere to the Eclipse
			Foundation Intellectual Property Policy.</p>
